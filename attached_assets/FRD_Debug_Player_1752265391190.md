### 12.2 Signal Type Definitions

#### Temporal Signals
- **Data Structure**: `{"timestamps": [...], "values": [...], "units": "string"}`
- **Valid Types**: Float, Integer, String, Boolean
- **Constraints**: Timestamps must be monotonically increasing
- **Examples**: Vehicle speed, battery voltage, system status

#### Spatial Signals
- **Data Structure**: `{"x": [...], "y": [...], "z": [...], "coordinate_system": "string"}`
- **Valid Types**: Float coordinates
- **Constraints**: Valid coordinate system required
- **Examples**: Vehicle position, obstacle locations, path waypoints

#### Categorical Signals
- **Data Structure**: `{"timestamp": [...], "category": [...], "states": [...]}`
- **Valid Types**: String categories, Integer states
- **Constraints**: Predefined category set preferred
- **Examples**: Driving mode, traffic light states, system modes

#### Boolean Signals
- **Data Structure**: `{"timestamp": [...], "value": [...], "description": "string"}`
- **Valid Types**: Boolean true/false
- **Constraints**: Clear state definition required
- **Examples**: Emergency brake active, collision detected, system ready

### 12.3 Plugin Interface Specification

#### Required Methods
```python
class PluginBase:
    def __init__(self, file_path):
        """Initialize plugin with data file path"""
    
    def has_signal(self, signal):
        """Check if plugin provides requested signal"""
    
    def get_data_for_timestamp(self, signal, timestamp):
        """Retrieve signal data for specific timestamp"""
```

#### Signal Definition Format
```python
signals = {
    "signal_name": {
        "func": callable_function,
        "type": "temporal|spatial|categorical|boolean",
        "description": "Human readable description",
        "units": "SI unit string",
        "coordinate_system": "coordinate system name",
        "valid_range": [min_value, max_value]
    }
}
```

### 12.4 Data Validation Rules

#### Format Validation
- File format must be recognized by system or plugin
- Data structure must conform to signal type requirements
- Timestamp format must be parseable and valid
- Coordinate systems must be supported or convertible

#### Content Validation
- Temporal data must have valid timestamp sequences
- Spatial coordinates must be within reasonable ranges
- Missing values must be properly indicated
- Data types must be consistent within signals

#### Performance Validation
- File loading must complete within acceptable time limits
- Memory usage must remain within system constraints
- Real-time updates must maintain required frame rates
- Plugin execution must not block main application
