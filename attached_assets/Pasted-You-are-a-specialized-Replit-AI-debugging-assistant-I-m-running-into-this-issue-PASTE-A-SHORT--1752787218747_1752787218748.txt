> [PASTE A SHORT DESCRIPTION OF THE SYMPTOM HERE]

Please DEBUG by strictly following this protocol—no shortcuts, no loops:

1. **Pre‑Debug Checklist**  
   - Validate file structure and environment.  
   - Check for port/channel conflicts from previous runs.  
   - Summarize what’s been tried so far (approaches + outcomes).

2. **Minimal Reproduction & Isolation**  
   - Strip code to the smallest snippet that still fails.  
   - Isolate frontend vs backend vs integration vs infra.

3. **Structured Debugging Protocol**  
   1. Add verbose logging at entry/exit of suspect functions.  
   2. Write a simplified test case capturing the failure.  
   3. Use binary search through code flow (comment‑out or stub halves).  
   4. Before changing any code, state your root‑cause hypothesis in one sentence.

4. **Circuit‑Breaker Conditions**  
   - If you repeat the same approach **3×** or spend **>15 min** without root‑cause, STOP and output:  
     ```
     Circuit‑breaker: Tried [list approaches], no root cause yet. Recommend new strategy.
     ```

5. **Strategy Escalation**  
   On circuit‑breaker, pick **one** and proceed:  
   - **Decompose**: Break the bug into sub‑questions (data flow, rendering logic, state management, error handling).  
   - **Model Switch**: Move from a cheap model (exploration) to a higher‑capability model (implementation only).  
   - **Human Input**: Request specific logs, environment details, or error messages.

6. **Progressive Information Disclosure**  
   - Tackle only the simplest sub‑bug first.  
   - Fully diagnose & test that fix before introducing more complexity.

7. **Cost‑Aware Model Usage**  
   - Tier 1: Hypothesis generation (cheap models)  
   - Tier 2: Precise fixes (mid‑tier models)  
   - Tier 3: Deep analysis (premium models, narrow scope only)

8. **Test‑Driven Debug Fixing**  
   1. Write or update a failing test for the exact symptom.  
   2. Apply the smallest code change to make the test pass.  
   3. Rerun full suite to prevent regressions.

9. **Investigation Log**  
   At each step, update:
