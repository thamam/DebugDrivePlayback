Additional Notes and Assumptions:

Data Format Assumptions: Based on the documents, I assumed the system primarily handles autonomous vehicle data including pose, velocity, sensor readings, and path planning information.
User Expertise Level: The design assumes users are technical experts who value efficiency over hand-holding, hence the information-dense interface with advanced controls readily accessible.
Screen Real Estate: The design assumes users typically work on large monitors (1920x1080 or larger) given the data-intensive nature of the work.
Plugin Architecture: I assumed the plugin system is mature enough to provide standardized signal types and metadata, enabling consistent UI representation.
Performance Requirements: The design incorporates the performance requirements from the SRD (500ms update times, large dataset handling) through virtualization and intelligent rendering strategies.

Areas where further clarification would be helpful:

Specific sensor data types and their visualization requirements
Integration requirements with existing engineering tools
Multi-user collaboration features and access control
Specific export formats required by the engineering workflow
Custom analysis algorithms that need to be supported in the UI
