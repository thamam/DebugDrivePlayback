# Documentation Cleanup Summary

**Date:** 2025-07-30

## Files Moved to TO_BE_DELETED

The following documentation files were moved to this directory as they are obsolete, redundant, or superseded by better documentation:

### Redundant Setup Guides
- **DOCKER_SETUP_SIMPLE.md** - Redundant with existing DOCKER_SETUP.md
- **MANUAL_SETUP_STREAMLINED.md** - Redundant with LOCAL_SETUP.md
- **SETUP_OPTIONS.md** - Redundant overview, setup info covered in main guides

### Obsolete Testing Documentation
- **V1.5_TEST_GUIDE.md** - Versioned test guide that's no longer current
- **TESTING_ROADMAP.md** - Outdated roadmap, superseded by TESTING_STRATEGY.md
- **TE_testing_usecases.md** - Obsolete testing use cases document
- **TESTING_INSTRUCTIONS.md** - Old testing instructions from root directory

### Obsolete Status/Summary Files
- **CONTINUATION_GUIDE.md** - Obsolete continuation notes for development
- **DATA_INTEGRITY_SUMMARY.md** - Obsolete data integrity summary

## Files Kept (Unique Value)

The following files were kept in /docs because they contain unique, valuable information:

### Setup & Configuration
- **DOCKER_SETUP.md** - Primary Docker setup guide
- **LOCAL_SETUP.md** - Primary manual setup guide  
- **BACKEND_SETUP.md** - Python backend-specific setup
- **TRIP_DATA_SETUP.md** - Data loading instructions

### Testing Documentation

- **TEST_RUNNER_GUIDE.md** - Test execution guide
- **TEST_INFRASTRUCTURE_STATUS.md** - Current test status
- **INTERACTIVE_TESTING_GUIDE.md** - Manual testing procedures
- **V1_RELEASE_TESTING_STORY.md** - Release testing procedures
- **V1_TESTING_QUICK_CHECKLIST.md** - Quick testing checklist

### Architecture & Features
- **ARCHITECTURE.md** - System architecture documentation
- **DATA_FLOW.md** - Data flow documentation
- **PERFORMANCE_GUIDE.md** - Performance optimization guide
- **WIDGET_WIZARD_DOCUMENTATION.md** - Widget system documentation

### Status & Summary
- **TESTING_SUMMARY.md** - Current testing summary
- **DDP_python-codebase-review-guide.md** - Python codebase review guide

## Rationale

The cleanup focused on removing:
1. **Duplicate setup guides** that covered the same information
2. **Versioned documentation** that's no longer current
3. **Obsolete status files** that contained outdated information
4. **Redundant overviews** better covered elsewhere

The remaining documentation provides comprehensive, non-redundant coverage of:
- Setup procedures (Docker, manual, backend, data)
- Testing strategies and procedures
- Architecture and system design
- Feature-specific guides (widgets, performance)
- Current status and summaries
