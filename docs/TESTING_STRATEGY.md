# Testing Strategy for Debug Drive Playback

**Last Certified: 2025-07-30**

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the Debug Drive Playback application, focusing on component isolation, integration testing, and user workflow validation.

## Testing Layers

### 1. Component Testing with Storybook

**Purpose**: Isolate and test individual components in various states and configurations.

**Implementation**:
- **Location**: `/stories/` directory
- **Coverage**: All major components and pages
- **Features**:
  - Component isolation with mock data
  - Interactive controls for testing different props
  - Visual regression testing capabilities
  - Accessibility testing
  - Responsive design testing

**Key Stories**:
- Error boundaries (normal, error, and recovery states)
- Navigation (different screen sizes and states)
- Data loading components (loading, success, error states)
- Widget system (creation, editing, error handling)
- Plugin wizard (step-by-step workflow)

### 2. Integration Testing

**Purpose**: Test how components work together and validate critical user workflows.

**Key Workflows to Test**:
1. **Data Loading Workflow**:
   - Load trip data from various sources
   - Handle connection failures gracefully
   - Fallback to demo data when needed

2. **Widget Creation Workflow**:
   - Create new widgets through wizard
   - Save and persist widget configurations
   - Load and display widgets on dashboard

3. **Plugin System Workflow**:
   - Install and activate plugins
   - Configure plugin parameters
   - Validate plugin functionality

4. **Error Recovery Workflow**:
   - Test error boundaries at different levels
   - Validate retry mechanisms
   - Ensure graceful degradation

### 3. Visual Testing

**Tools**: Storybook with Chromatic or similar visual testing tools

**Coverage**:
- Component visual consistency
- Theme switching (light/dark)
- Responsive design across screen sizes
- Error state presentations

### 4. Performance Testing

**Focus Areas**:
- Large dataset handling
- Widget rendering performance
- Memory leaks in long-running sessions
- Bundle size optimization

## Testing Commands

### Running Storybook
```bash
# Start Storybook development server
npm run storybook

# Build Storybook for production
npm run build-storybook

# Run Storybook tests
npm run test-storybook
```

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run integration tests
npm run test:integration

# Run e2e tests
npm run test:e2e
```

## Testing Best Practices

### 1. Story Organization
- Group stories by component or feature area
- Use descriptive story names that indicate the state being tested
- Include both happy path and error scenarios
- Document expected behavior in story descriptions

### 2. Mock Data
- Use realistic mock data that represents actual usage
- Create reusable mock data utilities
- Test with various data sizes and edge cases
- Mock external API calls for consistent testing

### 3. Accessibility Testing
- Include accessibility checks in stories
- Test keyboard navigation
- Validate screen reader compatibility
- Check color contrast and visual indicators

### 4. Error Scenario Testing
- Test all error boundaries with various error types
- Validate error recovery mechanisms
- Ensure user-friendly error messages
- Test retry functionality

## Component Testing Checklist

For each component, ensure the following are tested:

- [ ] **Default state**: Component renders correctly with default props
- [ ] **Loading state**: Shows appropriate loading indicators
- [ ] **Error state**: Handles and displays errors gracefully
- [ ] **Empty state**: Handles empty or missing data
- [ ] **Interactive state**: User interactions work as expected
- [ ] **Responsive design**: Works across different screen sizes
- [ ] **Accessibility**: Keyboard navigation and screen reader support
- [ ] **Theme support**: Works with both light and dark themes

## Integration Testing Scenarios

### Critical Paths
1. **First-time user experience**:
   - App loads successfully
   - Demo data is available
   - Navigation works
   - Basic widgets can be created

2. **Real data workflow**:
   - Connect to Python backend
   - Load real trip data
   - Visualize data in widgets
   - Save and restore sessions

3. **Plugin development**:
   - Create custom plugin
   - Test plugin in isolation
   - Deploy plugin to main app
   - Validate plugin persistence

### Error Scenarios
1. **Backend unavailable**:
   - Python backend connection fails
   - App falls back to demo mode
   - User is notified of limitation
   - Retry mechanism works

2. **Data corruption**:
   - Invalid data files
   - Malformed API responses
   - Partial data loading
   - Error recovery and user feedback

3. **Widget failures**:
   - Widget rendering errors
   - Configuration errors
   - Data binding failures
   - Error boundary isolation

## Continuous Integration

### Automated Testing
- Run Storybook tests on every PR
- Visual regression testing on main branches
- Performance benchmarks for critical paths
- Accessibility audits

### Quality Gates
- All stories must pass
- No console errors in Storybook
- Visual diff approval required
- Performance metrics within thresholds

## Testing Data Sources

### Mock Data Categories
1. **Trip Data**: Various trip lengths, signal types, data quality levels
2. **Widget Configurations**: Different widget types, layouts, parameters
3. **Plugin Definitions**: Sample plugins with various complexity levels
4. **Error Scenarios**: Network errors, parsing errors, validation errors

### Test Data Management
- Centralized mock data utilities
- Versioned test data sets
- Realistic data variations
- Edge case coverage

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Regular Testing Activities
- Weekly Storybook review for new components
- Monthly integration test updates
- Quarterly performance baseline updates
- Ongoing accessibility audit improvements

### Metrics to Track
- Test coverage percentages
- Story completion rates
- Visual regression detection rates
- Performance benchmark trends

This testing strategy ensures comprehensive coverage while maintaining development velocity and code quality.
