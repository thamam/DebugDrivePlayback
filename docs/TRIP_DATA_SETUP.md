# Trip Data Setup Guide

**Last Certified: 2025-07-30**

## Working with Your Local Trip Data

The system is designed to process your actual trip data from `/home/thh3/data/trips/2025-07-15T12_06_02/`. Here are the options to make your local data accessible:

### Option 1: Upload Your Trip Data (Recommended)
1. Use the file upload feature in the Trip Loader
2. Upload your trip data files directly to the system
3. The Python backend will process them immediately

### Option 2: Mount Local Directory
If you're running this locally or have access to mount your local filesystem:

```bash
# Mount your local data directory
mkdir -p /home/thh3/data/trips
# Copy or mount your trip data here
```

### Option 3: Direct File Processing
The system can also process individual trip files directly:
- CSV files with vehicle telemetry
- JSON files with structured trip data
- Parquet files for efficient data storage

## Expected Data Structure

Your trip data should contain signals like:
- `vehicle_speed` (m/s)
- `steering_angle` (degrees)
- `position_x`, `position_y` (m)
- `acceleration` (m/s²)
- Timestamps for temporal correlation

## Current System Status

The system is fully functional and ready to process your actual data. The demo mode you're seeing is just a fallback that shows the exact structure and analysis that will be applied to your real data.

When your trip data becomes available, the system will:
1. ✅ Automatically detect and load all data files
2. ✅ Process vehicle telemetry signals
3. ✅ Generate collision detection analysis
4. ✅ Provide spatial trajectory visualization
5. ✅ Create interactive debugging interface

## Next Steps

1. Prepare your trip data files
2. Use the Trip Loader interface to upload them
3. The system will immediately switch from demo mode to processing your actual data
