# Debug Player Framework

## Overview

This is a comprehensive debug player framework designed for visualizing and analyzing recorded vehicle data through an extensible plugin-based architecture. The application provides real-time visualization capabilities for autonomous vehicle debugging, collision detection, and spatial analysis.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

**Current Priority**: Infrastructure-first approach with Widget Wizard as the primary extensibility mechanism. Focus on building a strong, stable base that allows features to be added later through external widget/analyzer plugins rather than implementing specific features directly.
